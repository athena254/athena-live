# Felicity Tools

Utility scripts and modules to help Felicity, the Code Artisan, deliver repeatable, high-quality automation every day.

## Contents
- `build_tracker.py` – CLI for logging, reviewing, and planning your daily builds.
- `review_check.py` – (future) Code review rules, static checks, and style enforcement.

## Philosophy
- Pack each automation into a tiny CLI so Felicity can reuse it across projects.
- Keep builds documented and shareable with Athena and other agents.
