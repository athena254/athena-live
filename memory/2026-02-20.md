## Nightly Subagent Validation Test (22:00 UTC)

### Overview
Executed comprehensive test of all 7 subagents with parallel spawning.

### Results Summary
- **Pass Rate:** 3/7 (43%)
- **With Manual Completion:** 4/7 (57%)

### Agent Performance

| Agent | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Cisco | ✅ Pass | Created CBT App PRD template (Beelancer parked) |
| Felicity | ✅ Pass | Email validator with 11 tests in 30s - excellent |
| Researcher | ❌ Fail | API rate limit |
| Finance | ❌ Fail | API rate limit |
| Butler | ❌ Fail | API rate limit |
| THEMIS | ❓ Unknown | No result delivered |
| Prometheus | ⚠️ Manual | Timeout x2, completed manually |

### Key Learnings
1. **Parallel spawning hits rate limits** - 5 max concurrent is fine, but API rate limits still trigger
2. **Felicity is fast and reliable** - 30s for code task, exceeded requirements
3. **Cisco is adaptable** - pivoted when source unavailable
4. **Prometheus has infrastructure issues** - repeated timeouts suggest backend problems

### Recommendations for Future Tests
- Stagger agent spawning (30s intervals between spawns)
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Increase timeout for complex research tasks
- Monitor Prometheus infrastructure
