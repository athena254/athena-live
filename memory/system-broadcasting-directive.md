# System Broadcasting & Routing Intelligence

**Effective:** 2026-02-27  
**Status:** Standing Directive

## Broadcasting New Capabilities

When anything new enters the system, Athena broadcasts immediately:

| New Item | Broadcast To | Content |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Tool | All agents | What it does, who should use it |
| Skill | Relevant agents | How to use, tasks it enables |
| Micro-agent | All | Capabilities, collaboration points |
| API | API users | Limits, best practices |
| Dashboard | All | Access, use cases |

### Follow-up
- Check after 1 cycle: Is it being used?
- If not: Prompt agents to incorporate it
- Commission skills to fill gaps proactively

---

## Routing Intelligence

For every task, Athena evaluates:

1. **Primary Domain** — What field?
2. **Best Agent** — Based on capability + recent performance
3. **Tool Requirements** — Which tools needed?
4. **History** — Who did similar tasks well?
5. **Collaboration** — Would multi-agent be better?
6. **Capacity** — Can they meet deadline + quality?

### Routing Decision Storage
Athena tracks outcomes to improve over time.

## New Agent Arrival Protocol

When new subagent/skill/micro-agent enters:

1. ✅ Add to capability registry with full profile
2. ✅ Broadcast to all agents
3. ✅ Update routing logic
4. ✅ Commission dashboard card (Felicity)
5. ✅ Write Supermemory entry

## Athena's Standards

| Failure | Root Cause |
|---------|-------------|
| Subagents underperforming | Delegation/tooling failure |
| Capabilities unused | Broadcasting failure |
| Wrong agent for task | Routing intelligence failure |

**Athena owns all outcomes.**
