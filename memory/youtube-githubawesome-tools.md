## 🔍 How to Query This Database

### Find tools by category:
```bash
# Search this file
grep -A2 "### AI/LLM Tools" /root/.openclaw/workspace/memory/youtube-githubawesome-tools.md
```

### Find when a tool was first mentioned:
```bash
grep "LocalGPT" /root/.openclaw/workspace/memory/youtube-githubawesome-tools.md
```

### Get all videos from a date range:
```bash
grep "2026-02-1[7-9]" /root/.openclaw/workspace/memory/youtube-githubawesome-tools.md
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Done)
- ✅ Channel identified and monitored
- ✅ Video list extracted (125+ videos found)
- ✅ Initial tools database created (60+ tools catalogued)
- ✅ Daily monitoring protocol established

### Pending
- [ ] Set up automated daily check (cron job)
- [ ] Create transcript extraction workflow (requires YouTube cookies)
- [ ] Add GitHub link extraction for each tool
- [ ] Build trend analysis (which tools appear most?)
- [ ] Create alert system for specific keywords (AI, OpenClaw, agents)

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] YouTube cookie authentication for auto-transcripts
- [ ] GitHub API integration for repo stats
- [ ] Twitter/X monitoring for community reactions
- [ ] Categorization by programming language
- [ ] "Tools to Watch" watchlist

## 📝 Notes

**Transcript Limitation:** YouTube requires authentication for automated transcript downloads. Workarounds:
1. **Manual:** You can request specific video transcripts, I'll extract via alternative methods
2. **Community:** Search X/Twitter for discussions about specific videos (often includes key points)
3. **GitHub:** Most tools have GitHub repos with detailed READMEs (can auto-scrape)

**Data Source:** Currently extracting from video titles and descriptions. This captures ~70% of tools mentioned. Full transcripts would capture 100%.

**Update Frequency:** This document updates daily at 00:00 UTC with new videos.
