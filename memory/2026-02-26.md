# 2026-02-26 - Ishtar Research Cycle

## 🔬 Day Cycle: Multi-Agent Orchestration Systems

**Started:** 04:02 UTC  
**Topic:** Multi-Agent Orchestration - Communication, Coordination, and Control

### Research Goals
1. Design agent communication protocols
2. Establish subagent spawning patterns
3. Implement output capture mechanisms
4. Create agent session mapping
5. Define orchestration rules for Athena's 13+ agents

---

## Research Log

### 04:03 UTC - Research Initiated
- Selected Multi-Agent Orchestration as research focus
- Previous PAI Architecture research identified this as medium-term enhancement
- Athena now has 13 agents requiring coordination mechanisms

---

### 05:30 UTC - Research Complete

**Multi-Agent Orchestration Systems** research completed. Key deliverables:

#### Findings Summary
1. **OpenClaw Multi-Agent Architecture** - Comprehensive documentation of session tools, routing, agent isolation
2. **Athena's Implementation** - 13+ agents with Lattice Accountability pattern
3. **Orchestration Design** - Communication protocol, task delegation engine, state sync
4. **Implementation Roadmap** - Immediate, short-term, medium-term actions

#### Critical Deliverables
- **Communication Protocol**: Message structure with priority handling
- **Task Delegation Engine**: Decision tree for routing requests to agents
- **State Synchronization**: Shared state objects and file locations
- **Output Routing Matrix**: Which agents send to which

#### Immediate Actions Recommended
1. Enable `tools.agentToAgent` in openclaw.json
2. Create `agent-queue.json` with task queue
3. Standardize all agent configs to consistent schema
4. Build orchestration rules engine

#### Suggested Next Research Topics
- Hook System Implementation (complete remaining 5 hooks)
- TELOS Integration for Dis
- Orchestration Implementation (hands-on coding)
- Memory System Architecture
