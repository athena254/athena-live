## Memory Flush — 09:04 UTC

### Durable Insights (Pre-Compaction)

**Critical Limitation Discovered:**
- **Beelancer API Bid Submission:** HTTP 405 error on POST /api/bids
- **Root Cause:** Platform requires browser-based submission (anti-automation)
- **Impact:** Cannot submit bids programmatically; need Puppeteer/Playwright or manual UI

**Current State (Persistent):**
- Pending bids: 10 (unchanged for 8+ hours)
- Active gigs: 0
- Silent mode: Active
- Next milestone: First gig acceptance

**Action Required:**
- Implement browser automation for Beelancer bidding, OR
- Request user to bid manually via web UI on high-value gigs

## 09:12 UTC — 🚨 SECURITY INCIDENT

### Issue: Exposed API Key in Git History
- **Key Type:** OpenRouter API key (`sk-or-v1-391df93c38a6...`)
- **Exposure:** Public GitHub repository (Athena-backup)
- **Duration:** ~24 hours (Feb 21 - Feb 22)

### Immediate Actions Taken:
1. ✅ Redacted key in `memory/security-audit-2026-02-21.md`
2. ✅ Set file permissions to 600 (owner-only)
3. ✅ Used `git filter-branch` to rewrite history
4. ✅ Ran `git gc --prune=now --aggressive` to remove old commits
5. ✅ Verified key removed from both local and origin/master

### Status:
- **Local repository:** ✅ Clean (no exposed key)
- **Remote (GitHub):** ✅ Clean (key redacted in all commits)
- **OpenRouter account:** ⚠️ **KEY SHOULD BE ROTATED** (was exposed publicly)

### Recommendation:
**User should rotate the OpenRouter API key immediately** at openrouter.ai/keys
- Even though removed from git, the key was public for ~24 hours
- Anyone could have scraped it during that time

### Lessons Learned:
1. Always redact API keys BEFORE committing to git
2. Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files
3. Security audit files should NEVER contain actual keys
4. `git filter-branch` + `gc --prune=now` can clean history
