**Task:** Clean up and organize the workspace

---

## Summary

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Old Logs | ✅ Minimal | Central logs at `/root/.openclaw/logs/` (64KB) - no archiving needed |
| Git Hygiene | ⚠️ Needs Init | No commits yet - untracked files |
| Disk Usage | ✅ Clean | Workspace is ~52KB total |
| Skill Docs | ✅ Verified | 17 skills present with SKILL.md files |

## 1. Archive Old Logs

**Finding:** Central log directory exists at `/root/.openclaw/logs/`

- `logs/config-audit.jsonl` - 64KB (recent activity log)
- `logs/bot-fleet/` - 20KB (bot fleet logs)

**Action:** No archiving needed - logs are already managed in central location and are small.

---

## 2. Git Hygiene

**Workspace-coder Status:**
```
On branch master
No commits yet
Untracked files: 8 files
```

**Root OpenClaw Status:**
- Branch is ahead of origin/master by 1 commit
- 26+ modified files (mostly agent configs, credentials, cron runs)
- 13 untracked workspace directories (workspaces for different agents)

**Action Items:**
- Consider committing workspace-coder files
- Review which modified files should be committed vs ignored

---

## 3. Disk Usage Analysis

**Workspace-coder (total ~52KB):**
```
8.0K    AGENTS.md
4.0K    USER.md
4.0K    TOOLS.md
4.0K    SOUL.md
4.0K    IDENTITY.md
4.0K    HEARTBEAT.md
4.0K    BOOTSTRAP.md
```

**Action:** Workspace is already very clean - no large files to remove.

## Recommendations

1. **Git:** Initialize workspace-coder with initial commit for tracking
2. **No action needed** on logs (already clean)
3. **No action needed** on disk (already minimal)
4. **No action needed** on skills (all verified)
