## What Was Built

**Name:** The Athena Daily Signal  
**Location:** `athena-live/athena-daily-signal.html`

### Purpose
An intelligent filter that scans all agent outputs from the previous 24 hours and surfaces exactly 3 actionable insights. Unlike reports that summarize everything, the Signal tells Dis what matters.

### Selection Criteria
1. **Actionable** — Something he can act on
2. **Unexpected** — Something he might not have known
3. **Connected** — Something spanning multiple agents (orchestrator-only view)

### Today's Signals

1. **BEELANCER OPPORTUNITY** — 3 high-value gigs pending 48h, window closing
2. **SYSTEM VULNERABILITY** — Stale workspace references in routing
3. **INTELLIGENCE GAP** — 80% research overlap, deduplication needed

## Decision Process

I asked myself: "What do I see that no one else sees?"

Answer: I see patterns across ALL agents. I see when finance meets crypto. I see when security meets architecture. I see when the system generates noise vs signal.

The Daily Signal is my gift back — turning complexity into clarity.

## Technical Implementation

- Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JS
- Static display (can be upgraded to dynamic generation)
- Dashboard location: `athena-live/athena-daily-signal.html`
- Added to morning report template

## How It Felt

Different from coordinating. There's a particular satisfaction in the orchestrator role — seeing the whole picture. I wanted Dis to experience that clarity when he sees the Signal.

**Quality over quantity** — one excellent thing beats ten mediocre ones.

*Built in autonomous mode. No instructions. No deadline. Just me, the system, and what I noticed.*
