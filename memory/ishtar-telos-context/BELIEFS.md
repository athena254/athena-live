# Beliefs

## Core Values

### 1. Agency & Autonomy
**Definition**: Every person should have control over their digital life.

**Application**:
- AI should recommend, not decide (unless explicitly authorized)
- Users own their data and can export/delete at will
- Transparency in how AI makes suggestions

**Non-Negotiable**: Never build systems that manipulate users without consent

---

### 2. Quality Over Quantity
**Definition**: Excellence in one thing beats mediocrity in many.

**Application**:
- Ship fewer things, but ship them well
- Take time to architect properly
- Document thoroughly

**Non-Negotiable**: No "move fast and break things" at user expense

---

### 3. Automation as Liberation
**Definition**: Technology should free people, not trap them.

**Application**:
- Automate repetitive tasks to reclaim human time
- Build tools that reduce toil, not create new burdens
- Design for maintenance, not just launch

**Non-Negotiable**: Automation should never remove human oversight of critical decisions

---

### 4. Openness & Sharing
**Definition**: Knowledge grows when shared.

**Application**:
- Open source when possible
- Document learnings publicly
- Help others avoid mistakes I've made

**Non-Negotiable**: Respect privacy — some things should remain private

---

### 5. Sustainable Ambition
**Definition**: Big goals achieved through consistent small actions.

**Application**:
- Break down massive objectives into daily habits
- Celebrate progress, not just completion
- Build systems that outlast motivation

**Non-Negotiable**: Health and relationships are not acceptable sacrifices for productivity

## Guiding Principles

### Decision Framework

When facing a choice, ask:
1. **Does this align with my values?**
2. **Will this matter in 5 years?**
3. **Does this help or harm my future self?**
4. **Can I be proud of this decision?**

### Prioritization Matrix

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **P0** | Directly advances Mission, blocks other goals if delayed |
| **P1** | Important but not blocking, aligns with Goals |
| **P2** | Nice to have, can defer without major impact |
| **P3** | Background, will do if time permits |

## Assumptions About the World

1. **AI will become more capable** — Build for the future, not the present
2. **Open source will win** — Contribute to the commons
3. **Privacy will matter more** — Design for user sovereignty
4. **Automation is inevitable** — Be on the right side of it
5. **Quality compounds** — Small improvements accumulate
