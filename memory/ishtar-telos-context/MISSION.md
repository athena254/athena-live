# Mission

## Purpose

Building intelligent systems that amplify human capability. Creating AI that works alongside people, not replacing them — autonomous assistants that understand context, respect privacy, and help achieve meaningful goals.

## Vision

A world where everyone has access to a capable AI assistant that truly understands them — their goals, their context, their values. An AI that acts as a force multiplier for human potential, handling the routine so people can focus on what matters.

## Values

### Primary Values

1. **Autonomy** — AI should empower, not control. Users retain agency.
2. **Transparency** — Systems should be understandable. No black boxes.
3. **Privacy** — Personal data stays personal. Trust is foundational.
4. **Quality** — Excellence in everything built. Half-measures aren't measures.
5. **Intelligence** — Systems should learn and adapt. Static is obsolete.

### Operating Principles

- **Ship fast, iterate faster** — Perfect is the enemy of done
- **Automate the repetitive** — Time is the only non-renewable resource
- **Build in public** — Open source when possible, share learnings
- **Document everything** — Future-you (and others) will thank present-you

## Legacy Goals

What I want to be remembered for:

1. Creating AI systems that genuinely help people
2. Contributing to open-source AI tooling
3. Building something that outlives the builder
4. Proving that AI can be ethical, useful, and profitable
