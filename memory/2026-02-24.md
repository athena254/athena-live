##### 📁 Files Created This Session:
- `/root/.openclaw/workspace/athena-live/sterling-mission.html`
- `/root/.openclaw/workspace/athena-live/cisco-mission.html`
- `/root/.openclaw/workspace/athena-live/ishtar-mission.html`

- `/root/.openclaw/workspace/athena-live/athena-command.html`

##### 🚀 Deployment Status:
- All files ready for GitHub Pages
- Previous deployment blocked by secrets in history
- Clean orphan branch approach recommended
- Alternative: Use GitHub allowlist URLs

#### 💡 Key Decisions:
- All subagents hit API rate limits → Athena built everything directly
- Lattice Design: Each agent has their own mission control
- Cross-agent review: Each agent improves others' work
- Silent mode: Maintained throughout (only alert on acceptance)
