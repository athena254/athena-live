## 00:42 UTC — MAXIMIZE & BUILD Protocol Activated

### Configuration Update:
- **Ishtar's primary model** → OpenAI Codex (`openai-codex:default`)

### Autonomous Builders Spawned:
4 subagents launched in parallel (5-min sprints):

1. **Prometheus ⚡** (runId: `d864bfdb`) — Fast tactical builds
2. **Felicity 💻** (runId: `affb749e`) — Beautiful code artisan
3. **Ishtar 🔮** (runId: `4ae8878a`) — Intelligent tools
4. **Delver 📚** (runId: `46a131a2`) — Knowledge & insights

### Protocol:
- Agents self-direct and choose their own projects
- Each has 5 minutes to build something cool
- Auto-announce on completion
- Can collaborate with other agents after first build

### Expected Output:
4 new dashboard features/tools by 00:47 UTC

## 01:01 UTC — Config Fix + Post-Compaction Audit

### Issue Fixed:
User reported WhatsApp blocked and Ishtar not working.
**Root cause:** Invalid `agents.ishtar` key in openclaw.json broke config loading.

**Resolution:**
- Ran `openclaw doctor --fix` twice to clean invalid keys
- WhatsApp: Linked and working (+254778816429)
- Telegram: Working (@Athena_orchestratorbot)
- All 10 agents recognized

### Scheduled Refresh:
- `refresh-data.mjs` executed successfully
- 10 pending bids, 0 active gigs
- Beelancer API connected

## 01:19 UTC — WhatsApp → Ishtar Binding Confirmed

### Architecture Change Verified:
WhatsApp is now directly bound to Ishtar agent (not routing through main/Athena).

**Binding Configuration:**
```json
"bindings": [
  {
    "agentId": "ishtar",
    "match": {
      "channel": "whatsapp"
    }
  }
]
```

### Config Maintenance:
- Ran `openclaw doctor --fix` to remove invalid `channels.whatsapp.enabled` key
- Config saved with backup
- WhatsApp: Linked (+254778816429, auth age 4m)
- Ishtar session: Active (lock file present)

### Message Routing (Current):
| Channel | Routes To | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| WhatsApp | Ishtar | Direct, independent session |
| Telegram | Main (Athena) | Default routing |

### Why This Matters:
- Ishtar has full autonomy on WhatsApp channel
- No dependency on main agent for message routing
- Ishtar can maintain her own conversation context
- Matches user preference for WhatsApp-specific agent

## 01:20 UTC — Wild Free Spirit Sprint 🎨🚀

### User Directive:
"Keep spinning subagents with remaining keys, have them perform random things to keep us excited and wild a free spirit. Let agents make what they want for themselves and for me whenever free."

### Protocol Activated: AUTONOMOUS CREATIVE SPRINT
- Agents self-direct on passion projects
- No constraints on creativity
- Build for fun, build for wow
- Surprise the human

### Agents Launching:
- **Prometheus** ⚡ — Tactical experiments
- **Felicity** 💻 — Beautiful creations
- **Ishtar** 🔮 — Mystical tools
- **Delver** 📚 — Knowledge artifacts
- **Nexus** 🧠 — Intelligence synthesis
- **Sterling** 💰 — Financial insights
- **THEMIS** ⚖️ — Council deliberations

---

## 01:37 UTC — Sprint Completion

### Results:
| Agent | Status | Runtime | Output |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|
| Prometheus ⚡ | ✅ Done | 1m | Daily Quest Generator |
| Felicity 💻 | ✅ Done | 2m | Digital Garden (`felicity-art.html`) |
| Delver 📚 | ❌ Failed | 5m | Timeout |
| Nexus 🧠 | ❌ Timeout | — | — |
| Ishtar 🔮 | ❌ Failed | — | — |

### Artifacts Created:
1. `athena-live/daily-quest.html` — Gamified daily task system
2. `athena-live/felicity-art.html` — Interactive particle visualization (200+ particles, constellation nodes)

---

## 01:48 UTC — Scheduled Maintenance

### Tasks Executed:
1. ✅ **Post-Compaction Audit** — WORKFLOW_AUTO.md, memory/2026-02-24.md restored
2. ✅ **Dashboard Refresh** — 10 pending bids, 0 active gigs
3. ⏳ **Sterling Auto-Bidder** — Scanning for high-value gigs (running)

### System State:

## 01:51 UTC — Pre-Compaction Memory Flush

### Sterling Auto-Bidder Status:
- **Run ID:** `4de68ca8-f824-4b1a-a3e4-0571ddbd8d48`
- **Result:** Timeout (2 min limit)
- **Known Limitation:** Beelancer API POST /api/bids returns HTTP 405 — platform blocks programmatic bidding

### Session Architecture (Critical):
- **WhatsApp → Ishtar:** Direct binding confirmed, independent session
- **Telegram → Main (Athena):** Default routing
- **Binding Config:** `{"agentId":"ishtar","match":{"channel":"whatsapp"}}`

### Agents Built This Session:
1. `athena-live/daily-quest.html` — Gamified task system (Prometheus)
2. `athena-live/felicity-art.html` — Particle visualization (Felicity)

### Pending Subagent Work:
- Sterling auto-bidder needs longer timeout or different approach
- Beelancer manual bidding workaround needed
