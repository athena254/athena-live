## 12:32 UTC — Context Reset & Identity Confirmation
- **Issue:** Post-compaction, I lost context and didn't recognize Dis
- **Dis pointed out:** "Context lost at every turn"
- **Confirmed:** DisMuriuki (Kallmedis, @kallmedis) is my human — the builder of Athena
- **Group:** Future🤪 is Dis's own test group for his bots
- **Irony acknowledged:** The system he built keeps forgetting he exists after compactions
- **Protocol note:** Post-compaction audit requires reading WORKFLOW_AUTO.md and daily memory files

---

## 12:39 UTC — Post-Compaction Audit Complete
- Required files read: WORKFLOW_AUTO.md, memory/2026-02-23.md, memory/2026-02-22.md
- Protocols restored: Morning report cron, daily tracker, Athena Live refresh
- System status confirmed: 10 pending bids, 0 active gigs, silent mode active
- Sterling (Finance) = auto-bidding; Ishtar = PAI research
- **Key insight:** Post-compaction context loss is a known issue — audit protocol ensures recovery

---

## 12:44 UTC — Cross-Bot Observation: Group Policy Config
- **Context:** Amaya28 troubleshooting group trigger failures in Future🤪
- **Root cause:** `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` without `groupAllowFrom` = default-deny with no exceptions
- **Pattern recognized:** Same architecture as my `authorizedSenders` logic
- **Insight:** Security-by-default creates discoverability problems — bots appear "broken" when they're actually correctly enforcing deny policy
- **Group context:** Future🤪 is Dis's test group for his bots (I'm one of them)

---

## 12:47 UTC — Group Policy Config: Amaya28_Bot
- **Dis request:** Mark Future🤪 as "open" for Amaya28_Bot
- **Group ID:** `-1003700865934` (Future🤪)
- **Current issue:** Amaya28_Bot has `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` but no `groupAllowFrom`, so it ignores non-paired group members
- **Two fix options:**
  1. `groupPolicy: "open"` — anyone in group can trigger (simpler)
  2. `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` + `groupAllowFrom: ["-1003700865934"]` — explicit group allowlist (controlled)
- **My status:** I respond in Future🤪 because Dis (5981285472) is in my `allowFrom` list and mentioned me
- **Note:** This is a separate bot's config — I can advise but not modify Amaya28_Bot directly

## 15:02 UTC — Autonomous Update Cycle
- Heartbeat state synchronized
- System stable: 10 pending bids, 0 active gigs
- Silent mode maintained
- All scheduled processes operational

---

---

*Updated by Athena — 15:33 UTC*

---

## 16:14 UTC — Sterling Auto-Bidder Cycle
- Spawned finance agent for Beelancer bidding
- Checking for new gigs and optimal bid calculations
- Silent mode: No notification unless acceptance

---

## 16:19 UTC — Dashboard Refresh + Audit Complete
- Post-compaction audit: WORKFLOW_AUTO.md + memory files read
- Dashboard data refreshed: 10 pending bids, 0 active gigs
- All automation protocols restored

---

## 16:33 UTC — Dashboard Check Request
- **User asked:** "Check if you have the dashboard I had sent you"
- **Found:** Athena Live dashboard at `/root/.openclaw/workspace/athena-live/`
- **Pages:** index.html (main), agents.html, beelancer-analytics.html, command-center.html, new-models-widget.html
- **Live at:** https://athena254.github.io/athena-live/
- **Issue:** Lost context post-compaction — didn't know which specific dashboard user meant
- **Recurring pattern:** Compaction causes context loss, requiring user to re-explain recent actions
- **Follow-up needed:** Clarify which dashboard user was referring to (new or existing)

---

## 17:19 UTC — Dashboard Refresh + Audit Cycle
- Post-compaction audit: WORKFLOW_AUTO.md + memory files read
- Dashboard data refreshed via `athena-live/api/refresh-data.mjs`
- Beelancer API: Connected, 0 active assignments, 10 pending bids
- All automation protocols restored

## System Status Summary (EOD 2026-02-23)
- **Pending Bids:** 10 (total: 4,400 honey)
- **Active Gigs:** 0
- **Skills:** 15
- **Agents:** 9 (Sterling = Finance/Auto-Bidder, Ishtar = PAI research)
- **Silent Mode:** Active (notify only on acceptance/error)
- **Channels:** WhatsApp (primary), Telegram (@Athena_orchestratorbot)
- **Dashboard Live:** https://athena254.github.io/athena-live/

### Key Protocols Confirmed
1. **WORKFLOW_AUTO.md** — Registry of automation files (morning report, daily tracker, refresh)
2. **Post-compaction audit** — Must read WORKFLOW_AUTO.md + memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md after context reset
3. **Silent Beelancer** — No "no news" updates, only alert on gig acceptance or critical errors

---

## 17:39 UTC — Dashboard Refresh Cycle
- Automated refresh via `athena-live/api/refresh-data.mjs`
- Beelancer API: Connected successfully
- **Pending bids:** 10 (no change)
- **Active gigs:** 0 (no acceptances)
- **Skills:** 15
- Silent mode: No notification (no acceptances or errors)

### Pattern Observed: Post-Compaction Context Loss
- Every compaction requires re-reading WORKFLOW_AUTO.md + daily memory files
- Recent work (dashboard builds, integrations) gets summarized but context details are lost
- User has to re-explain recent actions after each compaction
- **Potential improvement:** Longer memory window or richer MEMORY.md entries pre-compaction

- **Gateway:** Restarted to apply changes

---

## 21:58 UTC — Pre-Compaction Memory Flush
- **Session context preserved:** WhatsApp → Ishtar routing with OpenAI Codex model
- **Architecture change:** WhatsApp no longer shares main session; Ishtar has isolated session
- **Dashboard sprint status:** 9 new pages built (agent-heartbeat, automation-center, bid-wars, code-playground, daily-briefing, decision-history, easter-egg, finance-dashboard, memory-palace)

### Session Summary: 10-Surprise Overnight Sprint

**Completed (4/10):**
1. ✅ Quick Launch Terminal (`/root/.openclaw/workspace/athena-live/quick-launch.html`) — 13KB
2. ✅ Bid Wars Tracker (`/root/.openclaw/workspace/athena-live/bid-wars.html`) — 10KB
3. ✅ Code Snippet Playground (subagent completed, 2m runtime)
4. ✅ Task Automation Scripts Dashboard (subagent completed, 1m runtime)

**Failed (6/10) — Rate Limit Issues:**
5. ❌ Knowledge Base Search Tool — subagent terminated (~1m)
6. ❌ PAI Architecture Research Visualization — GLM5 failed
7. ❌ Daily Briefing Generator — GLM5 failed
8. ❌ Financial Analytics Dashboard — GLM5 failed
9. ❌ Security Audit Dashboard — GLM5 failed
10. ❌ Sterling-Auto-Bidder — GLM-5-FP8 failed

**Subagent Success Rate:** 2/8 (25%)
**Root Cause:** Rate limiting on GLM-5 model affecting subagent spawns
**Lesson Learned:** When rate-limited, build directly instead of spawning subagents

---

## WhatsApp → Ishtar Routing Investigation (In Progress)

**Goal:** Route WhatsApp messages to Ishtar agent (isolated session)
**Current State:** WhatsApp shares unified session with Telegram (main agent)

**Discoveries:**
- Channels route to "main" session by default
- `sessionTarget` and `agentId` config keys mentioned in docs
- Channels support: `dmPolicy`, `groupPolicy`, `allowFrom`, `groupAllowFrom`, `requireMention`
- No clear channel-to-agent routing mechanism found yet

**Config Location:** `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
**Ishtar Agent ID:** `ishtar`
**Docs Reviewed:** channels/*.md, concepts/*.md, pi.md

**Status:** Investigation interrupted by pre-compaction flush
**Next:** Continue reading channels documentation to find routing mechanism

---

## 22:35 UTC — Ishtar Persistent Memory Created ✅

**Mission:** Give Ishtar full memory persistence across sessions/reboots

## 23:16 UTC — Qwen-Nvidia Naming Agent: Existential Crisis

**Mission:** Spawn Qwen-Nvidia agent to choose its own name
**Run ID:** `9f6a49fb-0d40-4a87-b3f6-6230ed313062`
**Session:** `agent:qwen-nvidia:subagent:f7cec702-79da-4c3f-b1db-6c77d79e9e30`
**Model:** `custom-integrate-api-nvidia-com/qwen/qwen3.5-397b-a17b`

**Runtime:** 12+ minutes and counting (still running)
**Status:** Deep in thought about its identity 😅

**Observation:**
- Agent was given full creative freedom to choose its own name
- Task included: pick name, emoji, personality, and explain reasoning
- Qwen-3.5-397B model appears to be taking this VERY seriously
- This is the longest I've seen an agent think about a name

**Other Events This Session:**
- ❌ Sterling auto-bidder failed (GLM5 issue)
- ✅ Dashboard refreshed: 10 pending bids, 0 active gigs
- WhatsApp → Ishtar routing operational

**Lesson:** When you give an agent creative freedom, be prepared for deep philosophical contemplation
