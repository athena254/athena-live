**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Author:** Athena (with Lattice input)  
**Status:** Pending Implementation

## 📊 Current System Analysis

### Existing Agents (10)
| Agent | Role | Status | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| Athena | Main Orchestrator | ✅ Active | Top hierarchy |
| Ishtar | Oracle/PAI Research | ✅ Active | Second hierarchy |
| Sterling | Finance/Bidding | ✅ Active | Needs outreach support |
| Felicity | Code Artisan | ✅ Active | Building Mission Control |
| Prometheus | Executor | ✅ Active | Needs QA |
| Nexus | Intelligence | ✅ Active | Needs knowledge base |
| Cisco | Security | ✅ Active | Full coverage |
| Delver | Research | ✅ Active | Overlaps with Ishtar |
| Squire | Operations | ✅ Active | General support |
| THEMIS | Council | ✅ Active | Deliberation only |

### Gaps Identified
1. **No client communication** - Sterling bids but no one talks to clients
2. **No marketing/outreach** - Passive bidding only, no active pitching
3. **No QA process** - Code goes straight to client without review
4. **No documentation** - Deliverables lack guides/manuals
5. **Knowledge scattered** - No centralized memory system
6. **No trend monitoring** - Missing AI/tech opportunities
7. **No disaster recovery** - Single point of failure risks
8. **Notification chaos** - Alerts across multiple channels
9. **No time management** - Deadlines tracked manually

**Key Principles:**
1. **Each agent's output = next agent's input**
2. **Mutual accountability** - Felicity answers to QA, QA answers to Client Relations
3. **No silos** - Memory agent serves all, Notification serves all
4. **Athena orchestrates, Ishtar advises**
5. **Departmental excellence** - Each agent owns their domain

3. **Outreach** (active acquisition)
4. **Documentation** (professional deliverables)
5. **Memory** (knowledge management)
6. **Trend Scout** (stay competitive)

## 🎯 Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Bid Win Rate | ~0% | 30%+ |
| Active Gigs | 0 | 3-5 |
| Client Satisfaction | N/A | 4.5/5 |
| Deliverable Quality | Variable | QA-approved |
| Response Time | Ad-hoc | <1 hour |
| Knowledge Retrieval | Manual | Instant |
