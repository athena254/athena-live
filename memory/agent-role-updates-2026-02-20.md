### 2026-02-22 Update — Role Clarification
- **Ishtar:** Retains PAI architecture/Oracle responsibilities, including the Personal AI Infrastructure repo; she is the personal companion for these domains.
- **Cisco:** Fully owns the BMAD Method repo and BMAD-related procedures, ensuring security and compliance workflows stay aligned with that methodology.
- **Delver:** Focuses on supporting research (documentation lookup, tools, quick answers) without the responsibility for PAI architecture-specific work.
- **Memory:** Athena keeps a synced copy of any PAI or BMAD updates and shares relevant pieces with the agent that needs them, ensuring each subagent stays focused.
