## Decision: Deprioritize Beelancer (Feb 27, 2026)

**Rationale:** API is permanently blocked (HTTP 405). Chrome extension not viable.

**Action:** 
- Stop spending time on Beelancer
- Focus on platforms that work

**Active Work Platforms:**
- Direct client work via Apollo/Hermes
- Gig platforms with working APIs (TBD)
- Existing active gigs (3 generating revenue)
